[{"body":"Each model has been initially assessed against the five FAIR criteria based on the information provided in the associated publication (see each model’s assessment on the Models page). In the process of making the model FAIR, additional information may need to be brought in beyond what was only provided in the publication. The accompanying GitHub repository for each model publication will serve to keep the score on the improvements of the FAIR components of the published model.\nEach of the five FAIR criteria are outlined below, with their associated “scoring” options. For the sake of this initiative, a model would be considered FAIR once it achieves the bolded option for each criterion.\nCriterion 1. Available code Is the model code available in a publicly accessible repository?\nYes No A link might be provided in a publication; but if the link is not working, we score it a No in the initial scoring.\nCriterion 2. License Does the model have a license?\nYes No Typically, license information is provided in the publicly accessible repository.\nCriterion 3. DOI Does the model code repository have a DOI?\nYes No If the model code is publicly available, does the location have a DOI?\nCriterion 4. Model Documentation Does the model has detailed documentation?\nWe provide a letter grade based on a casual reading of the model publication. Whether the model documentation is sufficient to understand the details of the model can only be found out in an actual replication exercise.\nA - Excellent.\nDocumentation provides clear rational for the purpose of the model and the assumptions behind the model formulation. There is a clear description of the processes, ideally with a visual representation (flow chart). All the variables and parameters of the model are clearly defined (including units and source of estimation for the parameters). The source of data files are provided. The details of the mechanism of the model are described by mathematical equations or pseudo code. B - Good.\nCompared to an A. there are some details missing like sources of data to define parameter values, the units, a clear description of the order in which processes are executed, etc. For small-scale theoretical models (without data) a detailed narrative based on logical statements could be sufficient for replication of the model. C - Satisfactory.\nCompared with B. Model (beyond a small theoretical model) lacks equations and pseudocode to describe the details of the model. D - Less than Satisfactory.\nCompared with C. Model does not defined all variables and parameters. Values of parameters are missing. Details of the processes of the model is missing. It might not be sufficient to replicate the model. E - Unsatisfactory.\nCompared to D. Lack of sufficient information to understand the basic structure of the model. Criterion 5. Clean Model Code Is the model code cleaned up and well commented?\nWe provide a letter grade based on a causal evaluation of the provided code (if code was provided). This criterion is not able to be graded at all until there is available code.\nA - Excellent. Defines variables and parameters (including units). Describes and explains each procedure and key processes of the model. Mentions version number and authors of the code. No outcommented lines of code to test the model, and no informal comments among authors. B - Good. Compared to A. Missing some details such as units, has not defined all variables and parameters, did not mention authors of the code. C - Satisfactory. Compared to B. Becomes a bit messy, includes unnecessary lines of test code and informal comments among authors. D - Less than Satisfactory. Compared to C. Does not define variables and parameters, does not provide description of procedures. One may understand the workings of the code, but it will take a lot of effort. E - Unsatisfactory. Code dump. No relevant comments, many outcommented lines of code, unclear what code is actually used for the model.

Check out the models currently selected for inclusion in this initiative on the Models page On the Models page, you will find links to the four categories of models that have been preliminarily selected for inclusion – Ecological Processes, Land Use, Cooperation, and Crowd Dynamics. Each category has between 20-25 model publications associated with it. Each category has a sub-page with a table identifying the initial assessments of each model’s “scores” on the five FAIR criteria, their current status in the making FAIR process (e.g., “Not yet started”, “In progress”), and a link to an associated issue in the GitHub coordination repository if the model is “In progress”. Note: a small selection of “Not yet started” models already have Github issue trackers associated with them, to illustrate how the process will look. 2. Identify what you’d like to work on! If you’d prefer to suggest a different model, please refer to our guidance on how to suggest a new model Note: for any newly suggested model, you will need to first assess the model publication on the five FAIR criteria. 3. Learn more about how to collaborate using Git and GitHub Git is a version control system, or VCS, that tracks the history of changes as people and teams collaborate on projects together. GitHub is an online code hosting platform for version control (using Git) that allows for collaboration on projects from anywhere. You will need a GitHub account – and to know some of the basic functionality and terminology of Git/GitHub – to participate in this initiative. Check out this step-by-step tutorial to get started, and/or read this introduction from GitHub Docs to dig a bit deeper. 4. For any model you are interested in, create or contribute to an associated issue in the coordination repository If there is already an existing issue for the model you’re interested in, there should be a link in the “GitHub Link” column of the table. This issue is where you will track and document progress and collaborate with others. If the model has not yet had any contributors, create a new issue by selecting the “Create Issue” button in the table row associated with the model, and a new tab will open with a pre-populated issue template in GitHub. Here’s an example issue for the following model citation: Nowak, M.A., \u0026 Sigmund, K. (1998). Evolution of indirect reciprocity by image scoring. Nature, 393(6685), 573-577. 5. Write a note in the issue \u0026 update the labels Write a note in the issue to indicate your intention to work on this model, and provide any other relevant details on your anticipated timeline or process for doing so.\nBe sure that the yellow labels are up to date, indicating the status by selecting either (or both) the “In progress” or “Collaborators needed” labels for the issue. To request changes to the yellow labels, make a comment to the issue. If you have just created an issue, two administrators will be automatically assigned to the issue so that they can create a new repository for this model.\nFollowing from our previous example of the Nowak \u0026 Sigmund (1998) model publication, below is a screenshot showing the two labels this issue should have (once work has begun):\n6. Get to work! You will get a notification on your associated issue that there is a new model repository ready for your use. In the meantime, use the documentation on the Process and How to Make FAIR pages as a checklist. Once you have received notification of your new model repository, please follow the instructions and guidelines on the repository’s README file for more information on using GitHub for collaboration (i.e., forking the repository, opening pull requests), the process for making models FAIR, suggestions for the repository file structure, and using the issue tracker for documentation of progress.

Ways to get involved This initiative is being built from the ground up, to support capacity-building efforts, foster networking opportunities, and involve the modeling community in the development of a public good.\nThere are many ways that you may wish to join the initiative, such as:\nAssigning models in courses you teach Designing and implementing replication projects Exploring the robustness of highly cited models through parameter sweeps or other sensitivity tests Assessing the FAIR-ness of your own models Utilizing high throughput computing resources for a selection of highly cited, newly FAIR models Contact Contact us at fair@comses.net for more information or ideas!\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"How to get started Are you ready to contribute to increasing the …","ref":"/docs/getting-involved/","tags":["collaborate","contact"],"title":"Getting Involved"},{"body":"For each of the five FAIR criteria considered, we provide guidance on how to meet those criteria when they are absent or inadequate. These guidelines will be continually updated based on experience, reflection, and learning fostered by this initiative.\nPlease share your experiences or reflections on the discussion page of our coordination repository so that we can all benefit from them! Additionally, you should create new issues in the associated GitHub repository for the model you are working on, to document the actions you are taking.\nPotential Problems \u0026 Solutions (by criterion) Criterion 1. Available code Problem Solution Code is not available in a publicly accessible repository. Contact the authors and inquire about the availability of the original code of the model.\nIf they provide the code: Ask whether it is OK to make the code publicly available. If the code is not findable (or authors do not want to make their code publicly available): Try to replicate the code from the model description of the publication (using the GitHub repository associated with this model). The basic results published in the publication are not replicable. While replication is not required to score the first criterion as “Yes” according to this initiative’s assessment guidance, it does indicate that there may be issues with the code that would inhibit reproducibility. This may be an issue with differences in program or package versions, missing pieces of the code, or other bugs. Criterion 2. License Problem Solution The model code has no license. Give it a license. If you received the code from the authors, consult with them on the selection of the license. Criterion 3. DOI Problem Solution The model code repository has no DOI. Archive the model code in an archive that provides a DOI, such as Zenodo or CoMSES Net. * See here for more information on making code citable by linking GitHub with Zenodo. * Learn how to archive and submit your model for peer review on CoMSES Net. Criterion 4. Model Documentation Problem Solution Documentation quality can be improved. Improve the model description. For example, describe purpose, use flow diagrams, use equations and pseudo code, describe submodels. Provide sources of datasets used by the model. In principle the model could be replicated from the model documentation. Criterion 5. Clean Model Code Problem Solution Code is not sufficiently cleaned up and commented. Clean up the code by removing outcommenting code, provide clear variable names, comment on the meaning of each procedure, remove.

This effort will contribute a public good to the modeling community, increasing transparency and building trust in many of the highly cited models that are frequently used (and built upon) in new research. While the initiative is primarily focused on the first two steps outlined below, it will open the door for replication and robustness checks and other associated opportunities.\nEach publication (and associated model) originally selected for this initiative has been assessed based on the five FAIR criteria: (1) Publicly accessible code, (2) License for the code, (3) DOI for the code, (4) Good documentation, and (5) Clean code.\nSteps in the process: Original assessment of the FAIR criteria See Assess a Model for more information This is done by the CoMSES team for the preliminary models for this initiative See the Models page for each model’s assessment score Make the model FAIR (across the five criteria) See How to Make FAIR for more information Periodically re-assess the five FAIR criteria of the model you’re working on Contact fair@comses.net and/or comment on the model’s issue within the coordination repository when this process has been completed Replication check Can you reproduce the originally-published results? Robustness check Sensitivity tests, parameter sweeps Opportunities to utilize high throughput computing, etc. Get your FAIR share Once you have made a model FAIR, it would be useful to get credit for your hard work! How can you make this an item on your CV? There are different options, dependent on what was involved and the results of your efforts. You will have the Github repository and the DOI of the model that you made FAIR. These are items you can put on your CV as outputs of your academic activities. You want to share your experience and lessons learned with a broader audience. You could do this via a blog post in RofASSS (Review of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation). You find something newsworthy that contributes to knowledge of the field. For example, the insights of the original model cannot be replicated, or the results are not robust when you do a more elaborate model analysis than could be done when the original model was published. In those cases, you should consider writing up a manuscript for a peer-reviewed journal, such as the Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation or Socio-Environmental Systems Modeling. Examples of such types of articles are here, here, and here. If you have any questions, please contact us at fair@comses.net.

We have selected and done the preliminary assessment of the FAIR criteria for a list of model publications that might resonate with different groups within the community. The list of initial models is a starting point, and we would like for other members of the community to suggest additional model publications. See below for more details on how this preliminary list of model publications was selected, and how to suggest a new model.\nIf you do not have access to the publication you would like to work on, please send a request for access to fair@comses.net.\nSelecting a model and getting started Each of the subpages is associated with one of the four categories of model publications preliminarily selected for this initiative. The subpage contains a table with each row corresponding to a model publication. The table lists:\nCurrent status in this initiative. Options include: Not yet started Looking for collaborators In progress Meets FAIR criteria! Link to a GitHub issue for the model (if work has begun on that model) Note: a small selection of “Not yet started” models already have Github issue trackers associated with them, to illustrate how the process will look. Assessment scores of the five FAIR criteria (see here for more information on scoring) Yes/No for the first three criteria A-E for the last two criteria Note that the fifth criteria was not able to be assessed if the code was unavailable (i.e., the first criterion is scored N). How were the model publications selected? Based on an analysis of 7500 agent-based modeling publications, we identified four areas of research in which there is substantial activity on agent-based modeling.\nThe four model categories are: Ecological systems and processes - theoretical and empirical models of ecosystems, from the gut to the global level. Land use - theoretical and empirical models of land use and land use change. Models may have a strong connection with GIS and cellular automata. Cooperation - largely theoretical models to stufy the evolution of cooperation and conflict among social biological actors. Crowds - theoretical and empirical models to study how groups, crowds, flocks, and swarms behave – including topics like escape dynamics, emergent patterns, and speed of crowd movements. We used the keywords “agent based model”, “individual based model”, “computer simulation”, and “multi-agent” within each category to get a list of relevant papers in Scopus. We went through the list of most highly cited publications and selected the first 20 articles that meet the topic and present an agent-based model.\nCan I suggest a model outside of the four categories? We have a fifth “Open” category for which community members can submit model publications outside the four above categories. Since our focus is on model publications that have had some traction, we use an arbitrary threshold of \u003e100 citations in Scopus to be considered for inclusion.\nAdditionally, we welcome groups to suggest their own list of 20-25 model publications on a different topic. This might be an opportunity to stimulate FAIR practices in your domain area.\nIf you have recommendations, please send the reference to fair@comses.net!\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Our goal is to provide training opportunities of practical use of FAIR …","ref":"/docs/models/","tags":"","title":"Models"},{"body":" FAIR Criterion Assessment Model Citation GitHub Link Code Available?

Many other modeling organizations endorse this initiative and seek to stimulate participation across the community.\nWhy should I get involved? The Making Models FAIR initiative may provide many opportunities for networking, paper publications, and training and learning. Community members may wish to collaborate on making a selection of highly-cited models FAIR in order to publish their work and share more widely with the scientific community. Or, they may seek to replicate findings or perform additional parameter sweeps and sensitivity tests for better understanding of some of the most classic models that are frequently re-used and referenced.\nThis initiative seeks to offer a straightforward way to engage with modeling communities such as CoMSES, while allowing room for the community itself to build and grow the initiative in ways that most suit their needs. For instance, additional models may be added to the initial list of publications / models, or new experiments with high throughput computing could be performed on newly FAIR models, etc.\nTo learn more, please visit the Getting Involved page, and feel free to contact us at fair@comses.net to share any additional ideas or interest.\nNavigating the site This website’s documentation pages provide information on the process involved in making a model FAIR, the currently-selected papers and their associated models, and the steps for getting involved with this initiative.
