The project is titled &amp;ldquo;Making a Model FAIR,&amp;rdquo; and it focuses on enhancing the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of a selected computational model through collaboration and application of FAIR principles.
We have prepared a comprehensive curriculum that outlines the project&amp;rsquo;s objectives, learning outcomes, and a proposed schedule.</description></item><item><title>Launching Making Models FAIR!</title><link>/blog/2023/03/15/launching-making-models-fair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/03/15/launching-making-models-fair/</guid><description>Imagine a world where models are available to build upon. You do not have to build from scratch and painstakingly try to figure out how published papers are getting the published results. To achieve this utopian world, models have to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). With the &amp;ldquo;Making Models FAIR&amp;rdquo; initiative, we seek to contribute to moving towards this world.
The initiative aims to provide a platform to learn the skills needed to make models FAIR.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/search/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
