&lt;p>We think it is important to introduce students in modeling courses about FAIR principles and we developed a template of a student group project. The project is titled &amp;ldquo;Making a Model FAIR,&amp;rdquo; and it focuses on enhancing the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of a selected computational model through collaboration and application of FAIR principles.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We have prepared a comprehensive curriculum that outlines the project&amp;rsquo;s objectives, learning outcomes, and a proposed schedule. You can access the curriculum in this &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1IzWLmS-bvfv9WYabXr1nq-K3bhvJ2vd_Q59mZgXAg_Q/edit">Google Doc&lt;/a>. The curriculum provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to the goals of your course and the expertise of your students.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By participating in this project, students will have the opportunity to:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Learn the basic principles of making models FAIR.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Gain hands-on experience with GitHub as a collaborative tool for group projects.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Develop valuable coding skills through code replication and modification.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Familiarize themselves with model documentation standards, such as the ODD protocol.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Understand the importance of software licenses and how to select an appropriate one.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Learn how to obtain a Digital Object Identifier (DOI) for model code.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Acquire essential skills for model analysis.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Publish their findings.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>We understand that every course has its unique requirements and constraints. Therefore, the project schedule provided in the curriculum is a general guideline that can be adjusted based on your specific needs and the selected model. Let us know about your experience with this curriculum.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Blog: Launching Making Models FAIR!</title><link>/blog/2023/03/15/launching-making-models-fair/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/blog/2023/03/15/launching-making-models-fair/</guid><description>
&lt;p>Imagine a world where models are available to build upon. You do not have to build from scratch and painstakingly try to figure out how published papers are getting the published results. To achieve this utopian world, models have to be findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). With the &amp;ldquo;Making Models FAIR&amp;rdquo; initiative, we seek to contribute to moving towards this world.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The initiative aims to provide a platform to learn the skills needed to make models FAIR. We provided an initial list of widely cited agent-based models, and now we can see how far we can get as a community in making them all FAIR! We expect that this initiative will be an avenue to identify potential improvements that could be made into a master list of &amp;ldquo;best practices&amp;rdquo; in making models FAIR. We also offer educational material, which will help you learn:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://comses.net/education/responsible-practices/">what FAIR is&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://www.comses.net/resources/standards/">how to do robust model documentation&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a href="https://comses.net/education/intro-to-git-github/">how to use GitHub&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>So, are you ready to join the community, improve your skills and knowledge, and contribute to this public good? Check out the &lt;a href="https://tobefair.org">initiative website&lt;/a>, learn the &lt;a href="https://tobefair.org/about/">proposed process&lt;/a>, and &lt;a href="https://tobefair.org/docs/models/">find a model&lt;/a> to work on!&lt;/strong>
&lt;br>
&lt;br>
&lt;em>Many thanks to those who have contributed to the development of the content, website, and GitHub architecture that will make this community initiative possible.&lt;/em>&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
